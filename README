I was attempting to do project euler in as many different languages as possible 
(see https://github.com/cdave1/euler).

The goal was to solve each problem in each different language before moving to the next problem.  
However, Haskell was proving itself as by far the easiest language to solve the problems in, and 
I was getting ahead of the other languages to the detriment of the learning goals I had when starting
out.  Because of this, I decided to split off my Haskell solutions into an entirely separate 
repository.
